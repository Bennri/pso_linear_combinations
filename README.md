# pso_linear_combination
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for hyperplane optimization.
A project to get more familiar with the Scala language.

The dataset, which was used to test the PSO algorithm was generated with the script `create_tmp_dataset.py`. A result of the algorithm is provided and can be found in the file `result.json`. Additional plots can be found in `pso_result.ipynb`.

### One possible result of the algorithm:

The dataset is obtained from: [https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_iris.html)
